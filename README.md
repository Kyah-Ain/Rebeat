# Rebeat

## Logline
  An introspective visual novel about a man rewriting his pivotal decisions, where every choice forces him to confront the past or remain trapped forever.

## Overview
  A visual novel about a man who's stuck in a loop of one of his unforgottable regret in his lifetime.
  <br><br>
  The idea is to immerse players in life-changing game choices that could affect others, and show them the cycle of life when one chooses to stay holding on to their past without resolving themselves, leaving them in a continuous cycle of regret that hinders their growth and development in life. This serves as a real-life representation of living with regrets due to holding onto the past without letting go or taking accountability for your actions.
